## Basic overview

This blog is created with Hugo, with is a static website generator and is very easy to setup. You can get a variety of themes from contributors on the official [hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) site.

The sources of this blog are hosted in my [blog Repository](https://github.com/johnnyleone/blog) on Github.

For building the static site i use a Dockerfile which is heavily inspired from [Jessie Frazelle](https://github.com/jessfraz/blog).

The part of hosting is provided by an Amazon S3 Bucket, which can simly get setup for static website hosting.
